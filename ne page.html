    <h2>Frontend vs Backend</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">&#127800;Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web development.<br>&#127800;The front end is what users see and interact with and the backend is how everything works. <br>&#127800;Each side needs to communicate and operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the website’s functionality. <br>
        &#127800;The front end is the part of the website users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. <br>&#127800;The backend, on the contrary, is part of the website users cannot see and interact with.<br>&#127800;
        The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend<br>On the other hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend.<br>
        &#127800;Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while those used for the back end include Java, Ruby, Python, and .Net.<br>&#127800;
        Let’s dive in deep to understand these terms better and know about some frontend and backend technologies that are popular these days</p>

    <h2>Front End Development</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">&#127800;<b>The front-end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:<br></b>

    &#127800;HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. You can learn this language with Geeksforgeeks Advanced HTML – Self-Paced course and master the concepts of advanced HTML. <br>
    &#127800; CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. Also, if you want to enhance your skills then enroll in Geeksforgeeks CSS Foundation – Self-Paced course and learn all new concepts of CSS.<br>
    &#127800; JavaScript: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on sites to make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhance the functionality of a website to run cool games and web-based software. Applicable in both front-end and back-end, Javascript is key to becoming a good developer. So start your web-development journey with Geeksforgeeks JavaScript Foundation – A self-Paced course today.<br> 
        There are many other languages through which one can do front-end development depending upon the framework for example Flutter uses Dart, React uses JavaScript and Django uses Python, and much more.</p>

    <h2>Back End Development</h2>
<p style="font-size:25px;">&#127800;The backend is the server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine.<br>
    &#127800;it is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.<br>
    &#127800;The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.
